    <h1>Main Concepts</h1>
    <h2>How the Web Works</h2>
    <p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. </p>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes &quot;what you see&quot; and <em>markup</em> which describes &quot;how it looks&quot;.</p>
    <h2>Tags and Elements</h2>
    <p>HTML documents are made of HTML <strong>elements</strong>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <strong>tags</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Why Computers are Stupid</h2>
    <p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.</p>
    <h2>Inline vs Block Elements</h2>
    <p>HTML elements are either <strong>inline</strong> or <strong>block</strong>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
